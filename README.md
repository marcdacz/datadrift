# DataDrift

DataDrift is a single-tenant automation platform that lets you connect to multiple data sources, define SQL-based data views, and run automated actions when specific conditions are met.

Teams can monitor data, detect changes or anomalies, and trigger workflows — such as notifications, web requests, or report generation — using a unified, SQL-driven approach.

## Key Capabilities

- **Data connections** — Connect to CSV files, JSON files, REST APIs, and databases.
- **SQL-based data tables** — Define reusable data views with SQL, regardless of the underlying source.
- **Automation rules** — Configure triggers, conditions, and actions to respond to data changes.
- **Manual & scheduled execution** — Run automations on demand or on a schedule.
- **Audit logs** — Track execution history, successes, and failures.
- **Templates & reports** — Generate emails and reports from reusable templates.
- **Role-based access** — Admin, Manager, and User roles with clear permission boundaries.

## Philosophy

DataDrift prioritizes:

- **Clarity over complexity**
- **Deterministic automation**
- **SQL as a universal interface for data**

The project is source-available and intended for learning, internal use, and experimentation. Commercial and SaaS use are restricted — see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.
